Accolite Problem set for Java interview.

Note 
- tests require fix in tests, or main classes depending upon the problem. 
- if the main class code appears bug to you then fix that.
- if the test code appears like not properly implemented, then fix that.
- use your experience and judgement around what would be best fix as there are multiple ways to make a test success.
- when fixing code/tests, DO NOT change the expected value mentioned in the test.
